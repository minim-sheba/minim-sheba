- 👋 Hi, I’m @minim-sheba, or Caitlin, as I'm sometimes known. I'm a composer-performer and artist, and a former corporate web interface developer. I also work as Research Administrator on this awesome music technology research project at Royal Holloway, University of London: https://cyborgsoloists.com
- 👀 I’m interested in music programming & web development, also in documenting creative practice
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Pure Data, working with Bela low-latency nanocomputers, and teaching myself electronics to make weird noises and flashy lights
- 💞️ Not looking for collabs right now because I'm in recovery from PhD burnout and have an insane number of commitments already, but what the heck, if you've an awesome idea and you'd like to work with me, ping me? You never know. 
- 📫 Reach me via Mastodon ([@minim@mastodon.art](https://mastodon.art/@minim)) or my website http://caitlinrowley.com/contact/
