I also work as Research Administrator on this awesome music technology research project at Royal Holloway, University of London: https://cyborgsoloists.com
- 👀 I’m interested in music programming & web development
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Pure Data, refreshing my Max/MSP skills, and working with Bela low-latency nanocomputers
- 💞️ Right now, I need to finish my PhD thesis, so not looking to collaborate right now!
